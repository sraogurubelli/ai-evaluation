# Adapter Examples

This directory contains example adapter implementations that teams can use as templates.

## Example Custom Adapter

`example_custom_adapter.py` - A complete template showing how to:
- Implement the Adapter interface
- Handle authentication
- Make API calls
- Parse responses
- Handle errors

**Usage**: Copy this file and modify it for your team's specific API requirements.

## Using HTTPAdapter

For most REST APIs, you can use the generic `HTTPAdapter` instead of creating a custom adapter. See the [Custom Adapters Guide](../../docs/custom-adapters.md) for examples.
