# Sample consumer SDKs

Sample consumers on top of aieval (not part of the installable package). **DevOps consumer:** `samples_sdk/consumers/devops` — index CSV, `run_devops_eval`, `create_devops_experiment`, `compare_csv_results`, etc. Run from repo root with `PYTHONPATH=.` so `samples_sdk` is importable. See [docs/migration.md](../docs/migration.md).
