"""Sample consumer SDKs for ai-evolution.

These samples demonstrate how to build consumer-specific helpers (e.g. ML Infra)
on top of the agent-agnostic framework. They are not part of the installable
package; copy or adapt for your project, or run from repo root with
PYTHONPATH=. so that 'samples_sdk' is importable.
