# Incident Response

**Severity:** P1 (immediate) — service down, data loss, security. P2 (< 1h) — major break. P3 (< 4h) — partial. P4 (< 24h) — minor.

**Steps:** Detect (alerts, health, logs) → Triage (impact, scope) → Mitigate (restart, rollback, scale) → Communicate → Post-mortem.

Check health, logs, metrics; identify component; apply fix or rollback. See [runbook](runbook.md).
